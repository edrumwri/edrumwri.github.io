D.\r\nin Computer Science (concentrating on robotics) under [Maja Mataric'](http://www-robotics.usc.edu/~maja/). I graduated from the University of Memphis (which has one of the top mathematics programs in the US) with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science (1999).\r\n\r\nI discovered the [first polynomial time model for simultaneous impacts between rigid bodies](http://robotics.gwu.edu/positronics/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WAFR10.pdf), the [first quadratic algorithm for inverting generalized inertia matrices](http://positronicslab.github.io/assets/pdfs/simpar.pdf), and the [first algorithm for computing inverse dynamics under the rigid contact model](http://positronicslab.github.io/assets/pdfs/inverse-dynamics.pdf) (with my student [Sam Zapolsky](http://samzapo.github.io)).\r\n\r\nMy work has been funded by NSF, Willow Garage, Open Source Robotics Foundation/NASA, and Hewlett Packard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lab\r\n\r\nI run the [Positronics Lab](http://positronicslab.github.io) (Planning Optimization and Simulation for Robotics) at [GWU](www.gwu.edu). Please see my lab web page for publications, students, facilities, and joining my research group.\r\n\r\n### Research\r\n\r\nMy research focus lies primarily in _simulating the dynamics_ of manipulator, humanoid, and legged robots and _applications of such simulations_. Simulation can speed the edit-compile-test cycle for manual programming, can be used to develop models used for robot learning, and can be an integral part of a robot's planning process.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, I am interested in algorithms for robot kinematics and dynamics, numerical algorithms (including algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization), and computational geometry and geometric intersection algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Contact info\r\n\r\nThe most reliable way to contact me is via email: ![Email address](http://edrumwri.github.io/assets/img/mail.png).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
