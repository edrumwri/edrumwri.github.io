<a id="bio" class="anchor" href="#bio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bio</h3>

<p>I graduated in 2007 from The University of Southern California with a Ph. D.
in Computer Science (concentrating on robotics) under <a href="http://www-robotics.usc.edu/%7Emaja/">Maja Mataric'</a>. I graduated from the University of Memphis (which has one of the top mathematics programs in the US) with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science (1999).</p>

<p>I discovered the <a href="http://robotics.gwu.edu/positronics/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WAFR10.pdf">first polynomial time model for simultaneous impacts between rigid bodies</a>, the <a href="http://positronicslab.github.io/assets/pdfs/simpar.pdf">first quadratic time algorithm for inverting generalized inertia matrices</a>, and the <a href="http://positronicslab.github.io/assets/pdfs/inverse-dynamics.pdf">first algorithm for computing inverse dynamics under the rigid contact model</a> (with my student <a href="http://samzapo.github.io">Sam Zapolsky</a>).</p>

<p>My work has been funded by NSF, Willow Garage, Open Source Robotics Foundation/NASA, and Hewlett Packard.</p>

<a id="lab" class="anchor" href="#lab" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lab</h3>

<p>I run the <a href="http://positronicslab.github.io">Positronics Lab</a> (Planning Optimization and Simulation for Robotics) at <a href="www.gwu.edu">GWU</a>. Please see my lab web page for publications, students, facilities, and joining my research group.</p>

<a id="research" class="anchor" href="#research" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research</h3>

<p>I am interested in the computational aspects of simulating the natural
world. Since 2005, I have focused on rigid body and multi-rigid body 
simulation, inverse dynamics, and modeling contact. I typically try to tie
my work in these topics to my interests in robotics.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate enough to grow up in the Information Age. I hope
to live long enough to see the first wave of the Robotics Age, which will
 (positive thing here) <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musks-open-source-openai-were-working-on-a-robot-that-will-do-your-household-chores/">I am not very
interested in robots doing my housework.</a> I am 
very interested in robots that
transform society, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_%26_Frank">those that help elderly people retain physical 
independence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bicentennial_Man">serve as trustworthy playmates and 
 guardians for our children</a>, and <a href="https://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2012/01/19/pr2-pet-project-gwu">watch over our homes when 
we're away.</a>

<p>When I was a teenager, I guessed that the most difficult part of creating 
a humanoid robot would be making it conscious. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGzRB4Pnq8">Pop culture seems to be 
focused on this as well.</a> I now think the biggest challenges
lie in the areas of locomotion and physical interaction.  
My interests in robotics and simulating the dynamics of the natural world has 
led to my recent research, with Ph. D. student <a href="http://samzapo.github.io">Sam Zaposlky</a>, in legged 
robot locomotion. I hope to be able to make a robot with the athletic
abilities of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HyomSW3PMQM?start=10">squirrels</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-atNakMWw">goats</a>.
